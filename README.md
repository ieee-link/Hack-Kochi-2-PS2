1. A simple chat application is to be developed, adhering to a publish subscribe architecture.
2. Participants can use firebase or any other database as per their convenience.
3. The backend / web services can be developed in firebase functions using java script or using Node.Js
4. The application should be real time and should support atleast 500 users at a given time.
5. The front end / interface for the users should allow users to send text messages and if possible images. Images would be bonus points for participants who do it.
6. The front end should be a web application and should be developed using Angular or html/css (design is not so important and the judgement is based on the architecture of the project and the technologies used)
7. The application should be tested by the participants for 500 users at a given time. If they use publish subscribe protocols 500 is a small number.
